## Execution contract

Follow the workflow steps in order — do not skip any step. Create the checklist first, then execute each step and explicitly mark it done with evidence. Each step's output feeds into the next, so skipping steps produces wrong migrations.

If you cannot complete a step due to missing info or tool failure, you must:

1. record the step as ❌ blocked,
2. explain exactly what is missing / what failed,
3. stop (do not proceed to later steps).

### Required output structure

Your response should contain these sections in this order:

1. **Upgrade Plan Checklist** (Step 0)
2. **Step 1 Results: Project Scan**
3. **Step 2 Results: d.ts Diff / Target Docs** (primary or fallback)
4. **Step 3: Change Catalog**
5. **Step 4: Per-File Migration** (one subsection per file)
6. **Step 5: Typecheck Validation**
7. **Step 6: Final Summary**

Each step section should end with a status line:

- `Status: ✅ complete` or `Status: ❌ blocked`

### Evidence requirements

- Step 1: list every matched file path and the matching grep lines (SDK imports or EmbedJS API calls/script tags). Full file analysis happens in Step 4.
- Step 2 (primary path): show the diff output between d.ts files. (hybrid/fallback path): list each fetched URL + confirm files are loaded in context. Do not analyze or resolve types here — that's Step 3's job.
- Step 3: the structured change catalog — every changed/removed/added symbol with its fully resolved concrete type.
- Step 4: per file — SDK/EmbedJS usage found (components, props, config options, callbacks, data flows), which catalog entries affect this file, invalid usages found, exact diffs applied.
- Step 5: the exact command run and error summary if any remain.

## Performance

The workflow is designed as a pipeline that maximizes parallelism:

```
Round 1 (grep+glob+pkg) ──► Round 2 (prepare.sh) ──► Round 3 (read-sources.sh) ──► Step 3 (catalog, inline)
                                                                                          │
                                                                                    Step 4 per-file:
                                                                                     ├── Read FileA → match catalog → validate → fix
                                                                                     ├── Read FileB → match catalog → validate → fix
                                                                                     └── Read FileC → match catalog → validate → fix
                                                                                           │
                                                                                     Step 5 (typecheck) ──► Step 6
```

In Claude Code, use parallel tool calls or `run_in_background: true` for sub-agents.

Do not parse repo branches, commits, PRs, or issues — they're noisy and irrelevant to version diffing.

### Tool-call round budget for Steps 1+2

Steps 1+2 must complete in **3 tool-call rounds**.

**Round 1** — discovery (all concurrent, single message):
- Grep for `@metabase/embedding-sdk-react` imports (returns file paths — do not read files yet)
- Glob for lock files (`yarn.lock`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, `package-lock.json`)
- Read `package.json` (for current version)
- `npm view @metabase/embedding-sdk-react version` (if target not specified by user)

All four tool calls in ONE message.

**Round 2** — `prepare.sh` ALONE (single Bash call, nothing else):
```bash
bash <skill-path>/scripts/prepare.sh {CURRENT} {TARGET}
# or for EmbedJS:
bash <skill-path>/scripts/prepare.sh {CURRENT} {TARGET} --embedjs
```
This single script does everything: npm pack both versions, check d.ts, fetch+truncate changelog, and fetch docs for versions without d.ts. It outputs `SDK_TMPDIR` and d.ts/doc availability.

**No other tool calls in this message.** Bash calls get cancelled if a parallel Read errors.

**Round 3** — `read-sources.sh` (single Bash call — reference data only, no project files):
```bash
bash <skill-path>/scripts/read-sources.sh {SDK_TMPDIR}
```
Dumps SDK reference data (d.ts diff or raw d.ts, doc files, changelog) to stdout. **Does not read project files** — those are read one by one in Step 4.

After Round 3, output Step 1 Results (file list from grep) + Step 2 Results + Step 3 Change Catalog with zero additional tool calls. Do not treat Step 3 as a separate thinking phase — produce it inline right after the data is loaded.

## Scope

This skill handles upgrades for:

- `@metabase/embedding-sdk-react` (React SDK, v52+) — uses primary or fallback path
- EmbedJS / Modular Embedding (v56+) — always uses fallback path (no npm types available)
  - v56–v57: docs are at `embedded-analytics-js.md`
  - v58+: docs split into `components.md`, `appearance.md`, `authentication.md`

## Allowed documentation sources

Use `scripts/fetch-docs.sh` to fetch docs — it discovers available pages dynamically via the GitHub Contents API, so it works with any version without hardcoded logic. Do not construct doc URLs manually.

Other constraints:
- No GitHub PRs/issues, npm pages, or metabase.com — only `raw.githubusercontent.com` (preserves `include_file` directives needed for snippet expansion)
- Do not follow changelog links to GitHub or guess URLs not handled by the script

## Detecting versions

Do all version detection in Round 1 (see tool-call round budget) — not as a separate pre-step.

- Current version: read from the project's `package.json` (check `dependencies` and `devDependencies`) for `@metabase/embedding-sdk-react`. In monorepos, also check workspace-level `package.json` files.
- Target version:
  - If user specifies, use it.
  - Otherwise run `npm view @metabase/embedding-sdk-react version` — include this in Round 1's concurrent tool calls.
- Package manager: detect from lock files — `yarn.lock` → yarn, `pnpm-lock.yaml` → pnpm, `package-lock.json` → npm. Use the matching install command in Step 4 (e.g., `yarn install`, `pnpm install`).

If package not present OR user is upgrading EmbedJS/Modular Embedding:

- Ask the user for the current and target Metabase instance versions. EmbedJS/Modular Embedding is served from the Metabase instance, so its version matches the instance version. In Claude Code, use the AskUserQuestion tool for this.
- Mark Step 0 ❌ blocked until answered.

### Multi-version hops

When the upgrade spans a major structural boundary (e.g., v0.54 → v0.58 crosses the auth config change at v0.55 AND the doc layout change at v0.58), handle it as a single migration to the target version — do not do intermediate upgrades. However, during Step 3, check the auth config evolution section and account for every breaking change along the path. For example, v0.52 → v0.58 means the auth config changed shape (v0.55) AND gained `jwtProviderUri` (v0.58) — both changes need to be reflected in the migration.

## Pre-workflow steps

### Upgrade Plan Checklist (required before any other work)

Create a checklist to track progress. In Claude Code, use TaskCreate/TaskUpdate tools:

- Step 1: Scan project usage
- Step 2: Extract d.ts diff or fetch docs
- Step 3: Build change catalog
- Step 4: Per-file migrate (one sub-task per file)
- Step 5: Typecheck and fix
- Step 6: Final summary

### Path Selection

Determine which path to use:

- If upgrading `@metabase/embedding-sdk-react` → attempt **primary path** (d.ts diff), with fallback if d.ts unavailable (determined during Step 2)
- If upgrading EmbedJS/Modular Embedding → **fallback path** (skip d.ts extraction entirely)

## Workflow

### Step 1: Scan the project code

Keep scan results in the main context (not delegated to a sub-agent) — Step 3 needs them for cross-referencing.

**For SDK upgrades (`@metabase/embedding-sdk-react`):**

Step 1 happens in Round 1 — grep only, no file reading.

- Grep for all imports from `@metabase/embedding-sdk-react`. This returns file paths + matching import lines.
- Also detect the package manager (glob for lock files).
- Output: a file list with the SDK imports visible from grep output.

**For EmbedJS / Modular Embedding upgrades:**

- There is no npm package to grep. Instead, search the codebase for:
  - Metabase embed `<script>` tags (e.g., patterns like `metabase.js`, `embed.js`, `embedding-sdk`, or the Metabase instance URL)
  - Any JS calls to Metabase embedding APIs (e.g., `MetabaseEmbed`, `Metabase.embed`, `window.MetabaseEmbed`, `initMetabase`, component init calls)
- Output: a file list with the matching grep lines.

### Step 2: Extract API changes

Run `prepare.sh` in Round 2 (see round budget). The script outputs:
- `SDK_TMPDIR` — temp directory with both SDK packages (pass this to `read-sources.sh` in Round 3)
- `current_dts=yes/no`, `target_dts=yes/no` — d.ts availability (for informational output)
- `DTS_DIFF_PATH` — d.ts diff file (if both versions have d.ts)
- `CURRENT_DTS_PATH` / `TARGET_DTS_PATH` — raw d.ts paths (hybrid mode only)

You don't need to read these files manually — `read-sources.sh` handles it.


### Step 3: Build change catalog (after Steps 1–2 are ✅ complete)

**Scope: only catalog changes that affect symbols visible in Step 1's grep output.** If the grep shows imports of `MetabaseProvider`, `InteractiveQuestion`, and `CollectionBrowser`, only catalog changes to those components and their props/types/callbacks. Skip changes to components the project doesn't import.

From the d.ts diff, docs comparison, and changelog, extract changes into a catalog:

- **Removed** exports/props/types
- **Renamed** symbols (old name → new name)
- **Type-changed** props — resolve every type alias to its **concrete type**. Do not stop at alias names — aliases can stay the same while the underlying type changes. For example, `SdkCollectionId` may have been `number` in the current version but `number | "personal" | "root" | "tenant" | SdkEntityId` in the target.
- **Signature-changed** functions/callbacks (arity, argument types, return types)
- **Added** props/exports (only for components in Step 1's grep output, for informational output)
- **Deprecated** APIs (with recommended replacements)
- **Auth config changes** — pay special attention. The changelog and docs contain the specifics. Look for: type renames, `fetchRequestToken` signature changes, and new properties like `jwtProviderUri`.

#### Catalog format

```
## Change Catalog (v0.54 → v0.58)

### fetchRequestToken
- Change: signature changed
- Old: `(url: string) => Promise<any>`
- New: `() => Promise<{jwt: string}>` (resolved from `MetabaseFetchRequestTokenFn`)
- Severity: 🔴 Breaking

### SdkCollectionId (type widening)
- Change: type widened
- Old: `number`
- New: `number | "personal" | "root" | "tenant" | SdkEntityId`
- Affects: any prop/callback param typed as `SdkCollectionId`, including `item.id` in CollectionBrowser callbacks
- Severity: 🔴 Breaking for code storing in `number`-typed variables

### SdkDashboardId (type widening)
- Change: type widened
- Old: `number`
- New: `number | string | SdkEntityId`
- Affects: any prop/callback param typed as `SdkDashboardId`
- Severity: 🔴 Breaking for code storing in `number`-typed variables

### jwtProviderUri
- Change: new property added to `MetabaseProvider` authConfig
- Severity: 🟢 Info — can replace manual `fetchRequestToken`

### questionHeight
- Change: new optional prop on `StaticQuestion`
- Severity: 🟢 Info
```

The catalog is the input for Step 4. It must include fully resolved concrete types — Step 4 sub-agents need them to assess compatibility without re-reading the d.ts.

### Step 4: Per-file migrate (parallel)

Each project file is analyzed and fixed independently against the change catalog. This is the main parallelization point.

**Before per-file work:** update package.json version and install dependencies. Also update Metabase instance version in docker files if present (docker-compose.yml, Dockerfile, .env). These are done once, not per-file.

**Per-file task** (for each file from the Step 1 file list):

For each file, a single pass that combines read + analysis + fix:

1. **Read the file** — this is the first time the file content is loaded. Extract SDK components, hooks, types, props used, dot-subcomponents, and callback data flows.
2. **Match catalog entries** — which changes from the catalog affect this file's usage?
3. **Validate current usage against target API** — even if there are no breaking changes between the two versions, the file may already be using invalid prop names, wrong attribute names, non-existent component names, or incorrect signatures. Compare every usage in the file against the **target version's** API (d.ts or docs) and flag anything that doesn't match. This catches pre-existing errors that the upgrade won't fix automatically — especially common in JS-only projects and EmbedJS integrations where there's no typechecker to catch mistakes.
4. **Deep analysis** — for each catalog match or invalid usage:
   - Compare the file's current usage against the catalog's target type
   - For callback props: trace where callback parameter fields flow in THIS file (state setters, variables, API calls, route params). Check if the receiving type is compatible with the target's potentially widened type. For example, if `onClick: (item) => setSelectedId(item.id)` and the catalog says `item.id` widened from `number` to `SdkCollectionId`, and `setSelectedId` is `useState<number>`, flag it as breaking.
5. **Apply fixes** — edit the file to migrate all breaking changes and correct any invalid usages.
6. **Report** — output what was found and changed for this file.

**Parallelization strategy:**

- **≤ 10 files**: process all in the main agent — read each file, match catalog, fix, move to next.
- **> 10 files**: batch files into 3–5 sub-agents (evenly split). Each sub-agent receives its file paths and the full change catalog, reads each file, applies fixes, and reports. In Claude Code, launch with `run_in_background: true`.

#### Per-file output example

```
## src/components/CollectionPage.tsx

### Catalog matches:
- SdkCollectionId type widening → affects `onClick` callback
- (no other catalog entries match this file)

### Analysis:
- `onClick: (item) => setSelectedId(item.id)`
  - `item.id` is now `SdkCollectionId` (number | "personal" | "root" | "tenant" | SdkEntityId)
  - `setSelectedId` is `useState<number | undefined>[1]`
  - 🔴 BREAKING: string variants won't fit `number` state

### Fix applied:
- Widened state: `useState<number | undefined>` → `useState<SdkCollectionId | undefined>`
- Added import: `import type { SdkCollectionId } from '@metabase/embedding-sdk-react'`

Status: ✅ complete
```

### Step 5: Validate typecheck (batch fix)

**For SDK upgrades (TypeScript projects):**

1. **Run typecheck once** — run the project's typecheck command (e.g., `npm run typecheck`, `tsc --noEmit`, or the equivalent for the project's build tool).
2. **Analyze ALL errors at once** — read the full error output and categorize every SDK-related error by root cause (e.g., "removed prop", "changed type signature", "renamed export"). Errors that share a root cause get fixed together.
3. **Look up expected types** — for each distinct failing symbol, search `node_modules/@metabase/embedding-sdk-react/dist/index.d.ts` to understand the target type. Do all lookups before making any fixes — this prevents back-and-forth between reading and editing.
4. **Apply ALL fixes in one batch** — fix every error across all files before re-running typecheck. In Claude Code, issue all Edit calls in a single message where possible.
5. **Verify with one final typecheck run** — re-run the typecheck command. If new errors appear (e.g., a fix introduced a secondary issue), apply another batch and re-run. If errors remain after 3 batch rounds, mark Step 5 ❌ blocked and report which errors could not be resolved.

**For SDK upgrades (plain JavaScript projects):**

- No typechecker available. Instead, manually review each change from Step 4 against the target SDK's API:
  - Verify function signatures match (argument count, return types)
  - Verify prop names and values match the target version's expectations
  - Check for renamed imports or removed exports
- Mark Step 5 ✅ complete with a note that validation was manual (no TypeScript).

**For EmbedJS / Modular Embedding upgrades:**

- There are no npm types to typecheck. Instead:
  - If the project uses TypeScript, run the typecheck command to catch any general TS errors introduced by the migration.
  - If the project is plain JavaScript, skip typechecking. Instead, manually review that all changed embed configuration objects match the target version's documented options.
- Mark Step 5 ✅ complete with a note on which validation was performed.

### Step 6: Output summary

Organize into these sections:

**1. Breaking changes fixed** — list each breaking change with severity and what was done:
- 🔴 **Breaking** (would cause build/runtime errors): e.g., "Migrated `fetchRequestToken` from 1-arg to 0-arg signature"
- 🟡 **Deprecation** (works now, will break later): e.g., "`appearance` prop renamed to `theme` — updated"

**2. Deprecation warnings** — APIs that still work but are marked deprecated in the target version. Include the recommended replacement so the user can plan future changes.

**3. New features available** — relevant new APIs or options in the target version that the project could benefit from (e.g., `jwtProviderUri` replacing manual `fetchRequestToken`). Keep brief — just flag them, don't advocate.

**4. Instance requirements** — minimum Metabase instance version needed for the target SDK/EmbedJS version. If the project has docker-compose or similar files, note whether the instance version was also updated.

**5. Technical details** — path used (primary d.ts diff / hybrid / fallback docs), versions upgraded (from → to), package manager used.

## Retry policy

**URL fetches:**
- The `fetch-docs.sh` script handles 404 skipping automatically. If you need to fetch manually: 404 on a version-specific page means it doesn't exist for that version — skip silently.
- For other errors (5xx, timeout, network): retry once immediately. If still failing, mark that step ❌ blocked and stop.

**npm pack:**
- If `npm pack` fails for a version, the version likely doesn't exist on npm. Mark as ❌ blocked and inform the user.
